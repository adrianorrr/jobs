      "\n",
      "Let me think about how I would approach this. First, I would read through the job description carefully. I'd look for any mentions of programming languages, frameworks, libraries, tools, databases, cloud services, etc. These are common tech stacks that employers look for.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, if the job is for a web developer, they might mention HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, etc. If it's a backend position, maybe Java, Spring, Python, Django, etc. For data science roles, Python, R, TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should make sure to extract each distinct technology. Sometimes job descriptions list them in bullet points, which makes it easier. Other times, they might be embedded in sentences, so I need to identify them correctly.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also need to avoid any explanations or extra information. Just the names, separated by commas. So if the description says \"Proficiency in JavaScript, React, and Node.js,\" I would list JavaScript, React, Node.js.\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, sometimes they might mention versions or specific tools. Like \"Experience with Python 3.8+\" or \"Familiarity with AWS (S3, EC2).\" In such cases, I should include the main technology without the version, unless the version is part of the name, like Python 3.x.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another thing to consider is whether to include both the language and the framework. For example, if they mention Ruby on Rails, that's two separate technologies: Ruby and Rails. So I should list both.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also be careful not to miss any technologies. Maybe go through the description multiple times to ensure I haven't overlooked any.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, if the job description is in Portuguese, I might encounter some technologies translated or referred to in Portuguese, but most tech terms are in English. So I should keep them in their original form.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but the response in the example was in Portuguese. So the instruction is to return the list in Portuguese? Or just the technology names as they are, which are usually in English.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking back at the example, the response was \"Nenhuma tecnologia solicitada.\" which is Portuguese. So maybe the user wants the final list in Portuguese, but the technology names themselves are in English. So the list would be in English, separated by commas, without any additional text.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the final output should be a list of technology names, in English, separated by commas, without any explanations or additional information.\n",
      "\n",
      "If there are no technologies mentioned, then the response should be \"Nenhuma tecnologia solicitada.\" as in the example.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also consider that sometimes job descriptions might list technologies in different ways. For example, \"Frontend development using React and Angular\" or \"Backend services built with Java and Spring Boot.\" So I need to extract React, Angular, Java, Spring Boot from those sentences.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another point is to ensure that I don't include job responsibilities or soft skills. Only the technical stacks. So terms like \"team player\" or \"good communication skills\" should be ignored.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also be cautious about acronyms. For example, \"AWS\" stands for Amazon Web Services, but it's commonly referred to as AWS, so I should list it as AWS.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, my approach would be:\n",

      "1. Read the job description thoroughly.\n",
